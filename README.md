# DESCRIPTION

This repository provides the \`cplay\` client to install Perl modules without using PAUSE.
This is using the \`pause-play\` GitHub repositories indexed by \`pause-index\`

\[https://pause-play.github.io/pause-index/\](https://pause-play.github.io/pause-index/)

Rather than using distribution tarball from PAUSE itself, \`play\` is relying on GitHub infrastructure to download distributions.

The repo \`pause-index\` host some index files which can be consumed to download and install most Perl modules.

\`cplay\` is the recommended CPAN client using these indexes and GitHub repositories.
You can read more about cplay client on the \[cplay website\](https://pause-play.github.io/cplay/).

## Install dependencies

## Build the fatpack version

# Known issues

Probably a lot at this point this is still in active development.

# TODO

- \[ \] setup GitHub pages
- \[ \] support for cpanfiles
- \[ \] write some pod/doc
- \[ \] write some tests
- \[ \] download the .idx tarball rather than the files themselves
- \[ \] check the .idx signature
- \[ \] purge .idx older than X hours
- \[ \] prefer a quick file read/scan?
- \[ \] log output to file
- \[ \] improve IPC::run3 and isolate it to its own module
- \[ \] ability to download trial version    Module@1.1\_0001
- \[ \] ability to download a custom version Module@1.3
- \[ \] better detection of make / gmake
- \[ \] check tarball signature
