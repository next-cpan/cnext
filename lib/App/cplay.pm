=head1 DESCRIPTION

This repository provides the `cplay` client to install Perl modules without using PAUSE.
This is using the `pause-play` GitHub repositories indexed by `pause-index`

[https://pause-play.github.io/pause-index/](https://pause-play.github.io/pause-index/)

Rather than using distribution tarball from PAUSE itself, `play` is relying on GitHub infrastructure to download distributions.

The repo `pause-index` host some index files which can be consumed to download and install most Perl modules.

`cplay` is the recommended CPAN client using these indexes and GitHub repositories.
You can read more about cplay client on the [cplay website](https://pause-play.github.io/cplay/).

=head1 INSTALLATION

=head2 Installing to system perl

This is using cplay to install itself.

    curl -L https://github.com/pause-play/cplay/raw/master/cplay | perl - App::cplay  
    curl -L https://git.io/cplay | perl - App::cplay

=head2 Local installation

   curl -fsSL --compressed https://github.com/pause-play/cplay/raw/master/cplay > cplay
   chmod +x cplay
   ./cplay --version

=head1 How to use cplay

=head2 Install a Perl Module

   # install a single module
   cplay A1z::Html
   cplay install A1z::Html
   cplay install --verbose A1z::Html

   # install multiple modules
   cplay First::Module Second::Module ...

=head2 Install a Perl distribution

You could use either a module name or a distribution name.

   # install a single distribution
   cplay A1z-Html
   cplay install A1z-Html
   cplay install --verbose A1z-Html

   # install multiple modules
   cplay First-Distribution Second-Distribution

   # install a custom version
   cplay A1z-Html@0.04

   # install a trial version
   cplay Devel-PPPort@3.57_02

=head2 Mix Perl modules and distributions

   cplay Module::Name Distribution-Name ...

=head2 Install Perl Modules from a cpanfile

    # by default use ./cpanfile
    cplay cpanfile
    cplay cpanfile .
    cplay cpanfile ~/cpanfile.custom

    # use one or more cpanfiles
    cplay cpanfile ~/cpanfile.1 ~/cpanfile.2 ...

    # set some feature with cpanfile
    cplay cpanfile --feature one --feature two

    # set some types/phases
    cplay cpanfile --with-requires --with-build --with-runtime --with-test

    # shortcut to enable all
    cplay cpanfile --with-all


=head2 Install a development or TRIAL version

   # install a trial version
   cplay Devel-PPPort@3.57_02

=head2 Install a module from a custom repository

   cplay --from-tarball ./path-to/custom.tar.gz
   # where :owner, :repository and :sha are replaced with the accurate values
   cplay --from-tarball https://github.com/:owner/:repository/archive/:sha.tar.gz

=item * [ ] setup GitHub pages

=item * [ ] write some pod/doc

=item * [ ] write some tests

=item * [ ] download the .idx tarball rather than the files themselves

=item * [ ] prefer a quick file read/scan?

=item * [ ] log output to file

=item * [ ] improve IPC::run3 and isolate it to its own module

=item * [ ] check tarball signature

=item * [ ] check builder type play for cplay, Build.PL and Makefile.PL...

=item * [ ] look at AcePerl and Acme BUILD.PL - configure_requires

=item * [ ] test default to t/*.t if not there

=item * [ ] find best location for .cpbuild root [local dir or home dir, ... ]

=item * [ ] cplay::Index cannot find version in file bug

=item * [ ] implement timeouts

=item * [ ] update installed modules: also flag all new provided modules

=item * [ ] --force to force reinstalling an existing module
