=head1 DESCRIPTION

This repository provides the `cplay` client to install Perl modules without using PAUSE.
This is using the `pause-play` GitHub repositories indexed by `pause-index`

[https://pause-play.github.io/pause-index/](https://pause-play.github.io/pause-index/)

Rather than using distribution tarball from PAUSE itself, `play` is relying on GitHub infrastructure to download distributions.

The repo `pause-index` host some index files which can be consumed to download and install most Perl modules.

`cplay` is the recommended CPAN client using these indexes and GitHub repositories.
You can read more about cplay client on the [cplay website](https://pause-play.github.io/cplay/).
